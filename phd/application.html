    <h2>Letter of intent</h2>

    <p>While you are assembling the materials to send to the Graduate School, also prepare a letter of intent of around 1,000 words, addressed to the PhD selection committee. This should explain your career goals and research agenda. Below are some questions and prompts to give you a sense of what the selection committee would like you to include in your letter of intent. We encourage you to illustrate your answers to these questions with relevant anecdotes and specific examples from your academic or non-academic experience.</p>

    <ul>

        <li>Why are you applying for a PhD and why have you chosen our Technical Communication and Rhetoric program?</li>

        <li>What aspects of our program particularly interest you and why? Which faculty do you see yourself working with most closely and why?</li>
        <li>Describe one or two particular research projects on which you worked for your Master’s degree.</li>
        <li>Why did this work interest you and what research questions motivated these projects?</li>
        <li>If you were to continue working on the projects, what further research questions might you pursue, especially in a Technical Communication and Rhetoric program?</li>
        <li>What professional and/or academic experiences have led you to believe you are ready for the kind of work that our PhD program will involve?</li>
        <li>What research questions in Technical Communication and Rhetoric do you want to pursue in the program?</li>
        <li>What career goals will this PhD in Technical Communication and Rhetoric help you to meet?</li>

    <h2>Graduate Instructor application</h2>

    <p>This face-to-face doctoral program prepares students for careers in academia, so applicants are strongly encouraged to apply for a Graduate Instructorship (GI-ship). A GI-ship pays an annual salary of $20,000.00 in addition to a tuition waiver and benefits, in exchange for teaching a 2/2 load (two courses each semester) and performing other responsibilities. USU provides excellent teacher training to PhD students, and our PhD students usually get the opportunity to teach a variety of courses during their program, which builds their Curriculum Vitae and positions them well for jobs in academia.</p>
    
    <p>PhD students will establish residency in their first year. They must remain in residence at least until achieving doctoral candidacy (ABD) and be engaged as active members of the USU academic community. Please note that students must be Utah residents to maintain their GI-ship.</p>

<p>Renewal of the GI-ship is contingent upon satisfactory performance in teaching, coursework, tutoring, and all other GI responsibilities. If a PhD student does not meet these requirements, the department may reevaluate and decide between a plan of remediation or dismissal from teaching duties. To be eligible for a GI-ship, PhD students must be considered to be full time by the Graduate School, a designation that includes teaching two courses per semester and being enrolled in at least 6 credit hours per semester as a student.</p>

<p>To apply for a GI-ship, write a paragraph of interest in a GI-ship in your Letter of Intent. This paragraph should describe any previous teaching experiences you have had that would make you a good candidate for a GI-ship. Also, indicate any teaching experience in the CV that you send to the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) with your application materials.</p>

    <h2>Writing Samples</h2>

    <p>Two writing samples (a total of 20-40 pages), exhibiting your best writing. These samples may include academic or non-academic writing, but at least one of the samples should demonstrate your critical and research skills. For each writing sample, write a <strong>one-page preface</strong>, contextualizing the sample: please describe your purpose for writing the document, the readers for whom you wrote it and how they affected your decisions while composing and revising the piece, and what you believe the sample demonstrates about your abilities to address a communication challenge.</p>

    <p>Send your letter of intent, the vita, and the writing samples directly to:</p>
