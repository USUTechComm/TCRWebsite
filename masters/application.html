    <h2>How to Apply</h2>

    <p>Master's students must apply for admission to the School of Graduate Studies. There is a $55 fee required with the application. Here are the steps in the application process:</p>

    <p>Instructions for steps 1-5 <a href="http://rgs.usu.edu/graduateschool/admissions" target="_blank">can be found here</a>.</p>

    <ol>

        <li>Fill out the online application.</li>

        <li>Pay the application fee.</li>

        <li>If you haven't already done so, take the GRE or MAT test.</li>

        <li>Provide a copy of your transcript(s).</li>

        <li>Provide three contacts for letters of recommendation.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>All supplemental items (steps 6-8 below) will be submitted online through the Graduate School's application system. Once you have created an account, filled out the online application, and paid the application fee, the Graduate School will email you with instructions for uploading the supplementary items (writing samples, letter of intent, and curriculum vitae)</p>

    <ol start="6">

        <li>
            <p>Send a letter of intent. This letter should describe your interest and experience in technical communication, as well as your future goals in the field. A well-written letter should also address why you are interested in the specific program to which you are applying.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>You will need to upload two samples of your professional writing. These samples should demonstrate your ability or potential as a professional communicator. Write a half-page introduction to each sample, explaining the context (your role as the writer, your audience, your purpose, etc.)</p>

            <p>This material will be read by the faculty, who will assess your application to decide whether you are ready to write at the level expected for scholarly assignments in a graduate seminar. The samples you submit should therefore be chosen and presented with that purpose in mind.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Upload a current CV (curriculum vitae). This CV should include your academic and professional writing experience. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
