                                <p>Dr. Colton started at Utah State University in the fall of 2014. His research addresses the intersections of rhetorical theory, ethics, and politics
within technical communication and related fields, from concerns of pedagogy to social justice. He is particularly interested in how classical and contemporary ethical frameworks inform the production, practice, and critique of collective activism via social and mobile media and accessibility technologies. He has published in Enculturation, the Journal of College Science Teaching, and the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy.</p>

                                <p>Dr. Hailey has been at Utah State University since 1994 teaching Web design and digital communication technologies such as eBook publication. In his research, using contemporary American genre theory, he examines methods for evaluating quality of content in complex and complicated information systems (CCISs). In the past, he used these same theories to research, design, and develop online instruction for Sandia National Labs, the colleges of engineering at Utah State University and University of Texas. As an aside, he examines emerging technologies and processes (e.g., migrating eBook technologies into corporate documentation), introducing that research into his classrooms. His research writing appears in a broad spectrum of technical communication and engineering publications, as well as book chapters and monographs.</p>
